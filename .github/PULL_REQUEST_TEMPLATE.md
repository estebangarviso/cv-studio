## Pre-Merge Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes (ESLint + Prettier)
- [ ] `pnpm type-check` passes with no errors
- [ ] No unused variables, parameters, or imports
- [ ] No `any` — use Zod schemas and inferred types

### Architecture
- [ ] Modules imported only via their `@modules/<name>` barrel (no internal paths)
- [ ] Domain layer has zero framework imports (pure TS + Zod)
- [ ] Server data uses TanStack Query; client state uses Zustand (not conflated)
- [ ] Forms use `react-hook-form` + `zodResolver`
- [ ] No external DI containers/decorators — React Context + hooks only

### Security
- [ ] No secrets committed; only public config exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- [ ] External input validated with Zod (client validation treated as UX only)
- [ ] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized input

### Tests
- [ ] Unit tests added / updated for new or changed logic
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes locally

### Documentation
- [ ] Public functions and types have doc comments
- [ ] `docs/` / `README.md` / `AGENTS.md` updated if conventions changed
