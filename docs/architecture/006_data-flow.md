# Data flow

A typical user action flows from the UI through hooks and use cases to the backend, then back into Query cache and (when needed) Zustand for client identity.

## Quick path

```
User action → Component (react-hook-form)
            → Hook (TanStack Query)
            → Use Case (domain)
            → Repository (port) → API client / HTTP → CV Studio API[^1]
                                        ↓
            Zod-validated response → Query cache (server state)
                                   → Zustand store (client identity)
```

[^1]: `CV Studio API` is a template placeholder rewritten by `pnpm init:project`.

## Layer trace

| Step | Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Component | Collect input via `react-hook-form` + Zod |
| 2 | Hook | Orchestrate `useQuery` / `useMutation` |
| 3 | Use case | Pure domain logic; no framework imports |
| 4 | Repository | Call API via `useApiClient()` transport or `getHttpClient()` |
| 5 | Response | Zod validation → Query cache; session facts → Zustand |

## Example: login

1. `LoginForm` submits credentials via `react-hook-form`.
2. `useLogin` mutation calls `loginUseCase.execute(creds)`.
3. `HttpAuthRepository` posts to `/auth/login` with `SessionSchema` validation.
4. On success: session stored in `useAuthStore` (client identity); server profile refetched via Query if needed.

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `zodResolver` exclusively |
| Server data | Lands in TanStack Query cache — not Zustand |
| Client identity | Session/auth facts may update Zustand on mutation success |
| Validation | Zod at form boundary and repository response boundary |

## Checklist

- [ ] Business logic in use cases, not route handlers
- [ ] Repositories are the only layer that talks HTTP
- [ ] Responses validated before entering Query cache
